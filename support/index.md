### Help commission an innovative new work!

We have already generated a great deal of momentum as we plan our 2017-18 season! We are excited for collaborations with Swiss composer Katharina Rosenberger, American composer Matt Sargent, and Switch~â€™s Artistic Director Jason Thorpe Buchanan.

We are raising commissioning fees for the creation of each new work to support the commissioning fee and remaining production expenses. Plans for next season include premieres and residencies in New York, Chicago, San Diego, San Francisco, and Europe.

Many thanks for your support,
Switch~ Ensemble
