            <strong>Victor Ibarra</strong>
            (b.1978, Mexico) has had a rich training in his own country as well as in France and Switzerland, with musicians such as Hebert Vázquez, José Luis Castillo, Edith Lejet, Daniel D’Adamo and Michael Jarrell. Honors include first place in the Alea III
            competition (USA), first place in Auditorio Nacional de Música de España competition, first prize in the Mauricio Kagel competition, the Zeitklang Award (Austria), among other international recognitions. Ibarra was recently selected in the Ensemble
            Aleph’s 7th International Forum for Young Composers, and as a member of the Casa de Velazquez – French Academy in Madrid. He has completed his Masters in Composition from the National Music and Dance Conservatory of Lyon, unanimously winning first
            prize and recognition by the Salabert Foundation. From 2014 he is named a member of the Sistema Nacional de Creadores de Arte from the National Fund for Culture and Arts of Mexico. Ibarra’s style draws on the most varied resources that outline a
            genuine language. Every part is immersed in micro-tonality, with a precise harmonic structure that becomes, many times intertwined and obsessive. Accented by the rhythmic energy that becomes an essential component of his speech or use of instrumental
            virtuosity, as a tool to create spaces and dimensions. The influence of French-spectralism helps him to work with a coloristic and timbral intention, although not exclusively, and a dialogue interdisciplinary which, usually set with the plastic arts,
            prints a personal mark on his work that is approached from clarity, in compositional instincts and ideals.

            <strong>Emanuele Palumbo</strong>
            (b.1987, Italy) lives in Paris. His first musical experiences came from playing in rock groups. He studied composition with Gabriele Manca in Milan, Gérard Pesson at CNSM in Paris, and computer music at IRCAM, cursus 1 & 2 with Hèctor Parra.
            Palumbo’s music has been performed by Ensemble Multilatérale, Ensemble Linea, Ensemble Talea, MDI Ensemble, and soloists such as Maria Grazia Bellocchio, Christophe Mathias, Josephine Besançon and Domenico Melchiorre. He attended masterclasses by
            Francesco Filidei, Franck Bedrossian, Pierluigi Billone and Raphaël Cendo. His works have been performed in venues and festivals as varied as the Manifeste Festival, the Royaumont Voix Nouvelles and Festival Pontino, and has been broadcast on Radio
            France. In his music he creates musical temporal structures based on sounds derived from an instrumental research, with an objective of achieving a strength and uniqueness of sound. Sometimes using accessories, he creates unusual modes of playing to
            obtain new sounds. The instrumental ensemble is charged in this with a new aura. He is currently working on a piece for piano and transducers, and he is starting a project of biophysiological music with dancers, performers and musician, in particular
            he is developing a device for physiological and emotional recognition (LISTEN).
