Summer 2016 brought to life some of the biggest projects we had tackled as an ensemble. [Switch~] completed a residency at Avaloch Farm Music Institute and performed a dozen world premieres as an ensemble-in-residence at the Valencia International Performance Academy and Festival.

Avaloch provides a supportive and generous framework for directed musical development. A range of ensembles rotate in-residence throughout the summer, with rehearsal space, lodging, and food provided in beautiful Boscawen, NH. It was the ensemble's first residency of this nature, and the time proved transformative for our series of concerts.

VIPA is an annual festival of contemporary music in Valencia, Spain. We were delighted to give premieres by participant composers Igor Santos, Samuel Gillies, Jeremy Corren, NamHoon Kim, Mathew Arrellin, Theocharis Papetrechas, Anna-Louise Walton, Tyler Gilmore, and Baldwin Giang. We also gave workshops and masterclasses for the participant composers on working with electroacoustic media, instrumentation, and notation.

Flutist Zach Sheets and pianist Wei-Han Wu also gave the European premiere of faculty composer [Rand Steiger's](http://rand.info/) *Light on Water*, for flute, piano, and electronics, with the composer as sound engineer. Take a listen to their 2014 performance here:

In addition to performances of works by faculty composer [Stefano Gervasoni](https://www.stefanogervasoni.net/), \[Switch\~\]'s programming and planning was animated by two flagship commissions: major new works by [Timothy McCormack](http://www.timothy-mccormack.com/) and [James Bean](jamesbean.info). James' work made use of his groundbreaking iPad notation software, *denm*, which has been taken up as a research project supported by IRCAM's Representations Musicales team. Performers play off of synchronized iPads linked by a local network, with sophisticated notation and visualization tools. The performers sustain long, whispered, fragile tones, ducking just below the surface of a complex architecture of standing yet ever-changing sound waves in the hall. The overall effect can be not just heard but *felt* as the entire space begins resonating with the very fabric of the music.

Tim's work, *karst survey*, is inspired by his fascination with geology. (If, like us, you didn't know what a karst was, you can go [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karst\). Tim's work required a decisive commitment to mastery of every aspect of its construction: instead of conventional rhythms and metrical structures, the work unfolds in "elastic time," with a system of cues precipitating the succession of events. With every performer fixated on the sounds around themselves and the intricate physical nature of Tim's musical language, *karst survey* achieves a lift-off from the customary obligations of keeping time. Instead of governing time through beats, pulse, or meters, Tim's sinuous, threadbare lyricism stretches time to a geological scale that transcends the familiar and yields a spectacular 18 minutes of music.


On *karst survey*, Tim writes: *An on-the-ground traversal through a weathered and disconnected terrain; a crawl way suddenly opening up into a cavern; a disappearing river; a compulsive urge for movement; a pushing forward, even if that leads straight down the dark maw of a sinkhole.*

We invite you to listen to our world premiere performance here:

But, one of the most vibrant aspects of \[Switch\~\]'s work together is, honestly, that the ensemble is such a supportive and caring workplace to make music. Days at VIPA and Avaloch were long and breaks hard-earned, but we certainly found plenty of time to eat, sightsee, and enjoy each other's company:

    <p>In the time since its premiere in 2017, we have come to know Alican Çamcı's "landscape, with inscription" in a more sophisticated and intimate way with each performance. There is something beguiling about the work; although its concept is clear from a first reading, its intricacies bloom with each renewed encounter.</p>

    <p>Alican is a composer living in Chicago. We premiered "landscape, with inscription" in May 2017 in our residency with University of Chicago and the CHIME Studio, with subsequent performances in our upstate New York tour in February 2018.</p>

<p>I first met Ali through the FORUM Internationale des Jeunes Compositeurs in Montréal in Fall of 2016, and was struck by his relationship to sound and musical thinking. As he puts it, "\[my\] recent works feature an investigation of sound as a potentially documentary medium. \[I seek\] to explore this aspect through the use of field and speech recordings, found sounds, everyday materials in relation to the performative dimension introduced by the musicians in a live situation."</p>

<p>About this work in particular, he writes, "*landscape with inscription* is a collision of two soundtracks: one is based on a constant reading and rereading of Ingeborg Bachmann's Im Gewitter der Rosen, and the other consists of field recordings made in Cowles Bog Trail located in Indiana Dunes, in December 2016. While the former takes place only in the context of performance, the latter (Cowles Bog Soundscape) is a sound piece that can be exhibited in a gallery setting. In doing so, my aim was to locate a condition of sound that is not-music (field recordings), and cast this against a more standard musical scenario that involves a highly granularized speech recording slowly coming together, along with its instrumental synthesis.</p>

    <p><em>Im Gewitter der Rosen</em></p>

    Wohin wir uns wenden im Gewitter der Rosen,<br/>
    ist die Nacht von Dornen erhellt, und der Donner<br/>
    des Laubs, das so leise war in den Büschen,<br/>
    folgt uns jetzt auf dem Fuß.

    Ingeborg Bachmann

    <p><em>In the Storm of Roses</em></p>

    Wherever we turn in the storm of roses,<br/>
    the night is lit up by thorns, and the thunder<br/>
    of leaves, once so quiet within the bushes,<br/>
    rumbling at our heels.<br/>

The canvas of the work is defined by a number of striking performance techniques. All the instruments are lightly amplified, allowing a sound engineer to capitalize on the intricate, intimate nature of the quiet sounds by reinforcing them with greater presence in the hall. The violinist places a cigarette filter between the strings, creating beautiful, unusual timbres and a typically unattainable palette of pitches. The flutist speaks parts of the poem into the face of a large gong---amplified in its own right with a contact mic---and the sympathetic resonance is captured to envelop the ensemble in a gentle shimmer.
