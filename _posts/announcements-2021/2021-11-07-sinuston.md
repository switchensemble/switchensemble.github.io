Review by Thoralf Winkler of our SinusTon Festival Concert Oct. 30: "The [Switch~ Ensemble] moved with its music - some of which was specially composed for the ensemble - at the limits of conventional music, and sometimes even exceeded this too. The concert-goers had to be prepared for a lot of experimental works, but they also got musical experiences that can only be given live." of Jason Thorpe Buchanan's *soliloquios del viento*, Winkler wrote: "Sounds and noises seem to want to tell of a secret - without ultimately revealing it."
