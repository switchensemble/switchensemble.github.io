In the time since its premiere in 2017, we have come to know Alican Çamcı's "landscape, with inscription" in a more sophisticated and intimate way with each performance. There is something beguiling about the work; although its concept is clear from a first reading, its intricacies bloom with each renewed encounter.

Alican is a composer living in Chicago. We premiered "landscape, with inscription" in May 2017 in our residency with University of Chicago and the CHIME Studio, with subsequent performances in our upstate New York tour in February 2018.


I first met Ali through the FORUM Internationale des Jeunes Compositeurs in Montréal in Fall of 2016, and was struck by his relationship to sound and musical thinking. As he puts it, "[my] recent works feature an investigation of sound as a potentially documentary medium. [I seek] to explore this aspect through the use of field and speech recordings, found sounds, everyday materials in relation to the performative dimension introduced by the musicians in a live situation."

About this work in particular, he writes, "*landscape with inscription* is a collision of two soundtracks: one is based on a constant reading and rereading of Ingeborg Bachmann's Im Gewitter der Rosen, and the other consists of field recordings made in Cowles Bog Trail located in Indiana Dunes, in December 2016. While the former takes place only in the context of performance, the latter (Cowles Bog Soundscape) is a sound piece that can be exhibited in a gallery setting. In doing so, my aim was to locate a condition of sound that is not-music (field recordings), and cast this against a more standard musical scenario that involves a highly granularized speech recording slowly coming together, along with its instrumental synthesis.

    <p><em>Im Gewitter der Rosen</em></p>

    Wohin wir uns wenden im Gewitter der Rosen,<br/>
    ist die Nacht von Dornen erhellt, und der Donner<br/>
    des Laubs, das so leise war in den Büschen,<br/>
    folgt uns jetzt auf dem Fuß.

    Ingeborg Bachmann

    <p><em>In the Storm of Roses</em></p>

    Wherever we turn in the storm of roses,<br/>
    the night is lit up by thorns, and the thunder<br/>
    of leaves, once so quiet within the bushes,<br/>
    rumbling at our heels.<br/>

The canvas of the work is defined by a number of striking performance techniques. All the instruments are lightly amplified, allowing a sound engineer to capitalize on the intricate, intimate nature of the quiet sounds by reinforcing them with greater presence in the hall. The violinist places a cigarette filter between the strings, creating beautiful, unusual timbres and a typically unattainable palette of pitches. The flutist speaks parts of the poem into the face of a large gong---amplified in its own right with a contact mic---and the sympathetic resonance is captured to envelop the ensemble in a gentle shimmer.
