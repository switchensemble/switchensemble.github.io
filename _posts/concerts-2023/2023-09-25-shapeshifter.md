For our first concert of the 2023-24 season, we are thrilled to present *Sounds from the Periphery*, a concert of four captivating quartets by composers Christopher Chandler, Victoria Cheah, Heather Stebbins, and Fausto Romitelli. Drawing from their April 2023 split disc *Roots*, Chandler's *still life* (2022) and Stebbins's *Among Arrows* (2021) feature vibrant, elemental, and intensely tactile electroacoustic music, creating a listening experience that hones into all the fine details of the sonic moment. In Cheah's introspective *We drank wine from the bottle on a rooftop next to god* (2017), a monolithic microtonal sonic landscape intertwined with sine tones gradually unfolds. At the heart of our program's sonic journey lies Fausto Romitelli's mesmerizing *Domeniche alla periferia dell'impero* ("Sundays on the Periphery of the Empire"). Romitelli's work celebrates the intricate interplay of timbre and texture, inviting you to delve into a world of profound sensory experience.
