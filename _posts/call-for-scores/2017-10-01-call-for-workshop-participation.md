## Workshop at San Francisco Center for New Music

**San Francisco Bay Area Composers**: The [Switch~ Ensemble] is happy to announce a call for scores and proposals to participate in a workshop at the San Francisco Center for New Music on December 13th, 2017 at 2pm.

Four to five composers will be selected for their works to be rehearsed, discussed, and read-through with recording. Entry and participation are free of charge, and this event is open to the public.

This workshop is made possible by generous individual donations to our crowdfunding campaign running through December 7th, and ticket sales for our Center for New Music concert December 13th at 8pm featuring works by Fausto Romitelli, Elvira Garifzyanova, Santiago Díez Fischer, Tonia Ko and more TBA. To support the work of emerging composers and our endeavors as an ensemble to fuse technology and performance, consider making a donation at: http://www.switchensemble.com/support

This is an opportunity to work closely with the ensemble, have your existing work or sketches for a new work read and recorded, as well as participate in a discussion with the ensemble and receive feedback from mentor composers and technicians Jason Thorpe Buchanan and Clay Mettens. We hope to receive works that we can consider for performances in the future, as well as to identify composers for future collaboration.

### Deadline

Submission materials due December 1st, 2017, at 11:59 p.m. EST.

### Instrumentation

- flute/bass flute/piccolo
- clarinet/bass clarinet
- violin
- cello
- piano

Electronics are possible, but given the brief duration of each reading session, composers must be fully prepared to operate their patch without any technical troubleshooting. We will have mics, speakers, cables, and an audio interface at the ready for each participating composer. Any technical requirements beyond this should be outlined in the submission and communicated to the ensemble in advance of the workshop.

### Submission

[Application Form](https://goo.gl/forms/x1N0RmxJm6pGXcKg2)

Rolling from Oct. 27 through Dec. 1. Will review materials upon receipt, 4-5 spaces are available.

**SUBMISSION MATERIALS**

Composers should submit either:

A) an existing work for flute, clarinet, violin, cello, and piano, or any subset. Doublings available. Recording optional.

B) a proposal for a 2-5 minute sketch that can be completed by Dec. 5 (with parts), accompanied by 2 existing portfolio pieces with recordings (if available) Scores should be submitted with links via Dropbox or a similar file sharing service. Recordings can be sent via a streaming service such Soundcloud, YouTube, Vimeo, or an .mp3 file via file sharing.
Submissions do not need to be anonymous.

We encourage you to share the works that best represent your abilities and interests as a composer. The [Switch~ Ensemble]'s mission is to create new works for ensemble and technology, therefore works or proposals for sketches intended to later include electronics or media will be given priority (though acoustic works and sketches without electronics are perfectly acceptable).

**ELIGIBILITY**

The [Switch~ Ensemble] is principally interested in supporting emerging composers, but we understand that "emerging" means something different to everyone—and that emerging composers come at a wide range of ages. Generally, we think of emerging composers as either (1) still enrolled in post-secondary or graduate study, (2) still seeking or only recently-appointed to full-time musical employment, or (3) still on a trajectory of development and self-renewal in musical thinking.

We particularly encourage composers without current institutional opportunities to work with professional ensembles to apply for this workshop, and all ages are welcome. Any submitted works that match our instrumentation or a subset of it are eligible for consideration for our future programming and repertoire. We hope to discover new works that we’ll be excited to perform on our future seasons, and make new contacts with composers for future collaboration.

Please submit scores and recordings (audio or video) with a link via Dropbox or streaming service on our online application form.
