We are looking forward to collaborating with composers from Harvard University during our Harvard Group for New Music residency from September 29 - October 6. We'll be premiering five new works by Harvard student composers including Caleb Fried, James Bean, Julio Zúñiga, Lauren Marshall, and Zeynep Toraman. More at http://hgnm.org/concert/switch-ensemble/
