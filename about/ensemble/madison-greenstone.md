about: Madison Greenstone
---
Madison is a New York based clarinetist whose ‘beautiful and haunting’ playing ‘creeps noisily away from the void’ (Foxy Digitalis). They perform across a wide array of experimental music contexts as a soloist, improvisor, and chamber musician. Madison’s solo performance practice, exstatic resonances, pushes the limits of innate instrumental expressivities by treating the meeting of instrument and embodied technique as creative of a site of indeterminacy and generative instability. Their approach to the clarinet embraces and instigates chaotic timbral actions, difficult-to-reign sonorities, and the harmonically rich and noisy resonances that have a vivid inner life and movement.

Madison is the clarinetist of TAK Ensemble, “one of the most prominent ensembles in the United States practicing truly experimental music” (I Care If You Listen), and can be heard on labels such as Wandelweiser Editions, Another Timbre, TAK Editions, Unknown Tapes, New Focus Recordings, eë editions (AT), and Impakt Collective (DE). Their first solo album, Resonance Studies in Ecstatic Consciousness is housed on the experimental and improvised music label Relative Pitch Records.

As a soloist, Madison has performed at the Vigeland Mausoleum (Oslo), ISSUE Project Room (NYC), Fire Over Heaven (NYC), Night of Surprise (DE), Silo City (Buffalo), Petersburg Art Space (DE). Other notable performances have been as a soloist in Brian Ferneyhough’s La Chute d’Icare (conducted by Steve Schick), as presented by the New York Philharmonic Kravis Nightcap Series with TAK Ensemble, as part of the Merce Cunningham Centennial in Los Angeles. Madison has performed in the KKL Luzern (CH), Elbphilharmonie (DE), and Walt Disney Concert Hall (LA).

Madison is currently a doctoral candidate at UC San Diego, where they learn greatly from the mentorship of Anthony Burr, Charles Curtis, and Amy Cimini. [www.madison-greenstone.com](www.madison-greenstone.com)
