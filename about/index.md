## Artistic Statement

A new music ensemble for the 21st Century, the [Switch~ Ensemble] is dedicated to the creation and performance of new works for chamber ensemble and multimedia. At the core of each performance is our commitment to the total integration of technology and live musicians. We strive for compelling artistry achieved through the seamless creation, production, and execution of new music.

We believe that working directly with composers throughout their creative process–in a medium where the score is a departure point rather than a finish line–allows for new and thrilling musical possibilities. Our collaborative practices are optimized for needs that differ radically from the creation and rehearsal of acoustic music, allowing for continuous experimentation and refinement.

We have enjoyed fruitful collaborations with both emerging and established composers, including Anna-Louise Walton, Alican Çamci, Igor Santos, Katherine Young, Stefano Gervasoni, Stefan Prins, Wojtek Blecharz, Anthony Vine, Rand Steiger, Philippe Leroux, and many others. Additionally, we have performed the American premieres of works by Alexander Schubert, Elvira Garifzyanova, Santiago Diez-Fischer, Lisa Streich, and Anthony Pateras.

[Switch~] contributes to the future of the genre by strongly advocating for and commissioning the music of a new generation of emerging young composers. We have commissioned new works by Timothy McCormack, James Bean. Our 2017-2018 season includes the premiere of new works by Matt Sargent, Esaias Järnegard, and Adrien Trybucki, residencies at Cornell University, Ithaca College, Bard College, and Buffalo State, as well as performances and recitals in New York City and San Francisco, including repertoire by Marianthi Papalexandri-Alexandri, Tonia Ko, and Sivan Eldar.

In the summer of 2016, the [Switch~ Ensemble] served as ensemble-in-residence at the Valencia International Performance Academy in Spain. At VIPA, [Switch~] worked alongside faculty and participant composers, led workshops and masterclasses, and premiered over a dozen new works. In May of 2017, [Switch~] premiered works for ensemble and electronics by seven doctoral students as ensemble-in-residence at the University of Chicago. Other recent highlights and invitations include a residency at Avaloch Farms Music Institute, the CD release of Christopher Chandler’s Smoke and Mirrors on the SEAMUS label, and featured concerts on the MATA Interval Series, the New York City Electroacoustic Music Festival, the Queens New Music Festival, the Vanguard New Music Series at Kent State University.

Founded in 2012 at the Eastman School of Music, the [Switch~ Ensemble] looks toward the future of contemporary music. We are dedicated to performing high-level chamber music integrated with cutting-edge technology and supporting emerging and early career composers. We are passionate about helping to build a diverse canon of 21st century works that leaves space for all voices—especially those that have historically been excluded from our field.
