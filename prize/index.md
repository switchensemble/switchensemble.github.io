The [Switch~ Ensemble] invites entries for our 2020 commissioning prize from composers and sound artists of all backgrounds.

**The new work:**

<div>
  <ol>
    <li>1. Must include technology in some way and be scored for [Switch~]’s core ensemble: Flute, Clarinet, Saxophone, Violin, Cello, Piano, and Percussion.</li>
    <li>2. Is expected to be produced collaboratively and in an active working relationship with the ensemble and its members; we expect most of this interaction will take place digitally and remotely, over phone, Skype, etc.</li>
    <li>3. Should have a mutually agreed upon duration. We'll discuss the length and scope of the new work with the winner, but expect a work of at least 8 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
</div>

**Entry fee:** ~~$15 payable by PayPal here.~~

**Eligibility:** Open to anyone, *except* members of [Switch~ Ensemble] and composers with whom [Switch~] has existing commissioning contracts.

**Application process:** ~~Please fill out the following form.~~

Composers are invited to submit two or three work samples. At least two work samples must include some form of audio or video recording. Work samples should be shared via file sharing sites like Dropbox or streaming services like SoundCloud or Youtube. Please ensure links stay active through at least May 2020. If using Google Drive or Dropbox, please be sure to click "share" rather than copying and pasting your browser’s address bar, as that will not work correctly.

Entries **do not** have to be anonymous. Demographic information is optional but we encourage applicants to submit information about how they self-identify in the appropriate fields. There is an optional field at the end to share any other information you feel might be necessary or useful.

While one composer will win the Commission Prize for a new work in 2020-21, any submitted works that match [Switch~ Ensemble]’s instrumentation will be considered for performance in future seasons. For example, four finalists from our 2016-17 commissioning competition had existing works performed in the subsequent seasons.
