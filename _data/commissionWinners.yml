  biography: |
    Esaias Järnegard (b.1983, Sweden) was born and raised in Stockholm, finished his bachelor studies in composition in 2008 and his master in 2013 under the guidance of mainly Ming Tsao and Ole Lützow-Holm in Gothenburg, Sweden. During the academy years he also took part in different international master classes and lessons with teachers such as Chaya Czernowin, Claus-Stephan Mannkopf, Isabel Soverall, Dmitri Kourliandski, Franck Bedrossian, and others, as well as private lessons with Pierluigi Billone.

    What has been most defining artistically is the possibility during recent years to work closely with musicians throughout the composing process. As a result, I mainly write chamber music with an increasingly phenomenological approach- to try to emphasize the relation between body and instrument, not just the physicality of sound, but also the magic of it- to be in touch with sound.

    His music has been performed and broadcasted throughout Europe, North America and Asia at by ensembles and soloists such as Richard Craig, Peter Veale, Seth Josel, Hugo Ticciati, Karin Hellqvist, Emma Richards, Weston Olencki, Christian Smith, Gageego!, MDI, SurPlus, Moscow Contemporary Music Ensemble, Asamisimasa, Vertixe Sonora, Handwerk, VocalLab Nederland and Nouvel Ensemble Moderne a.o.

Honors include first place in the Alea III competition (USA), first place in Auditorio Nacional de Música de España competition, first prize in the Mauricio Kagel competition, the Zeitklang Award (Austria), among other international recognitions.

He has completed his Masters in Composition from the National Music and Dance Conservatory of Lyon, unanimously winning first prize and recognition by the Salabert Foundation. From 2014 he is named a member of the Sistema Nacional de Creadores de Arte from the National Fund for Culture and Arts of Mexico. Ibarra’s style draws on the most varied resources that outline a genuine language. Every part is immersed in micro-tonality, with a precise harmonic structure that becomes, many times intertwined and obsessive. Accented by the rhythmic energy that becomes an essential component of his speech or use of instrumental virtuosity, as a tool to create spaces and dimensions. The influence of French-spectralism helps him to work with a coloristic and timbral intention, although not exclusively, and a dialogue interdisciplinary which, usually set with the plastic arts, prints a personal mark on his work that is approached from clarity, in compositional instincts and ideals.
