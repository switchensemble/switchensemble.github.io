Congratulations to the five composers selected for our Center for New Music Workshop! **Danny Clay**, **Andrew Harlan**, **Julie Herndon**, **Daniel Meyer O'Keeffe**, and **Aida Shirazi**. Their submissions each illustrated both strong imagination and technical ability, and we look forward to collaborating with them soon! Thank you to the many talented composers who submitted!
