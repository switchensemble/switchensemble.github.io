<h3>2016-17 International Commissioning Prize Winners</h3>

<p>After ten weeks of listening, discussing, questioning, and voting, we are very pleased to announce the [Switch~ Ensemble]'s 2016-17 International Commissioning Prize Winners. We thoroughly enjoyed reviewing the nearly 300 submissions from 42 countries, familiarizing ourselves with the work of many composers who were new to us. We were astounded at the quality of the work across the board, and as a result, have decided to award not one but TWO commissions for our coming seasons. Without further ado, congratulations to <strong>Adrien Trybucki</strong> and <strong>Esaias Järnegard</strong>, our commission prizewinners, who have been selected to write brand new works for the [Switch~ Ensemble] to be premiered next season in 2017-18!</p>

<p>Due to the overwhelming number of composers who we felt were deserving of recognition, we would also like to congratulate our runner-up, D. Edward Davis, and our finalists: <strong>Elvira Garifzyanova</strong>, <strong>Victor Ibarra</strong>, <strong>Emanuele Palumbo</strong>, <strong>Daniel Silliman</strong>, and <strong>Igor C. Silva</strong>. All of these composers are doing amazing work, and we invite you to please listen and read more about them and their music. There were many strong contenders for these prizes, and we look forward to hearing more from every one of you in the future. Our 10 member jury discovered many new pieces and composers whose work we believe in, and as an ensemble we are excited to begin considering possibilities for programming works by applicants, both the composers listed below and the many more who we couldn't include here, in our coming seasons.</p>

<p>Thank you all for your submissions, and we look forward to hearing more of your incredible work in the future!</p>

      <strong>Esaias Järnegard</strong> (b.1983, Sweden) was born and raised in Stockholm, finished his bachelor studies in composition in 2008 and his master in 2013 under the guidance of mainly Ming Tsao and Ole Lützow-Holm in Gothenburg, Sweden. During the academy years he also took part in different international master classes and lessons with teachers such as Chaya Czernowin, Claus-Stephan Mannkopf, Isabel Soverall, Dmitri Kourliandski, Franck Bedrossian, and others, as well as private lessons with Pierluigi Billone.
    </p>
    <p>
      What has been most defining artistically is the possibility during recent years to work closely with musicians throughout the composing process. As a result, I mainly write chamber music with an increasingly phenomenological approach: to try to emphasize the relation between body and instrument, not just the physicality of sound, but also the magic of it: to be in touch with sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      His music has been performed and broadcasted throughout Europe, North America and Asia at by ensembles and soloists such as Richard Craig, Peter Veale, Seth Josel, Hugo Ticciati, Karin Hellqvist, Emma Richards, Weston Olencki, Christian Smith, Gageego!, MDI, SurPlus, Moscow Contemporary Music Ensemble, Asamisimasa, Vertixe Sonora, Handwerk, VocalLab Nederland and Nouvel Ensemble Moderne a.o.

            <strong>Victor Ibarra</strong>
            (b.1978, Mexico) has had a rich training in his own country as well as in France and Switzerland, with musicians such as Hebert Vázquez, José Luis Castillo, Edith Lejet, Daniel D’Adamo and Michael Jarrell. Honors include first place in the Alea III
            competition (USA), first place in Auditorio Nacional de Música de España competition, first prize in the Mauricio Kagel competition, the Zeitklang Award (Austria), among other international recognitions. Ibarra was recently selected in the Ensemble
            Aleph’s 7th International Forum for Young Composers, and as a member of the Casa de Velazquez – French Academy in Madrid. He has completed his Masters in Composition from the National Music and Dance Conservatory of Lyon, unanimously winning first
            prize and recognition by the Salabert Foundation. From 2014 he is named a member of the Sistema Nacional de Creadores de Arte from the National Fund for Culture and Arts of Mexico. Ibarra’s style draws on the most varied resources that outline a
            genuine language. Every part is immersed in micro-tonality, with a precise harmonic structure that becomes, many times intertwined and obsessive. Accented by the rhythmic energy that becomes an essential component of his speech or use of instrumental
            virtuosity, as a tool to create spaces and dimensions. The influence of French-spectralism helps him to work with a coloristic and timbral intention, although not exclusively, and a dialogue interdisciplinary which, usually set with the plastic arts,
            prints a personal mark on his work that is approached from clarity, in compositional instincts and ideals.

            France. In his music he creates musical temporal structures based on sounds derived from an instrumental research, with an objective of achieving a strength and uniqueness of sound. Sometimes using accessories, he creates unusual modes of playing to
            obtain new sounds. The instrumental ensemble is charged in this with a new aura. He is currently working on a piece for piano and transducers, and he is starting a project of biophysiological music with dancers, performers and musician, in particular
            he is developing a device for physiological and emotional recognition (LISTEN).
