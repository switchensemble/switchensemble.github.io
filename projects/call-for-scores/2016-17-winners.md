## 2016-17 International Commissioning Prize Winners

After ten weeks of listening, discussing, questioning, and voting, we are very pleased to announce the [Switch~ Ensemble]'s 2016-17 International Commissioning Prize Winners. We thoroughly enjoyed reviewing the nearly 300 submissions from 42 countries, familiarizing ourselves with the work of many composers who were new to us. We were astounded at the quality of the work across the board, and as a result, have decided to award not one but TWO commissions for our coming seasons. Without further ado, congratulations to **Adrien Trybucki** and **Esaias JÃ¤rnegard**, our commission prizewinners, who have been selected to write brand new works for the [Switch~ Ensemble] to be premiered next season in 2017-18!

Due to the overwhelming number of composers who we felt were deserving of recognition, we would also like to congratulate our runner-up, **D. Edward Davis**, and our finalists: **Elvira Garifzyanova**, **Victor Ibarra**, **Emanuele Palumbo**, **Daniel Silliman**, and **Igor C. Silva**. All of these composers are doing amazing work, and we invite you to please listen and read more about them and their music. There were many strong contenders for these prizes, and we look forward to hearing more from every one of you in the future. Our 10 member jury discovered many new pieces and composers whose work we believe in, and as an ensemble we are excited to begin considering possibilities for programming works by applicants, both the composers listed below and the many more who we couldn't include here, in our coming seasons.

Thank you all for your submissions, and we look forward to hearing more of your incredible work in the future!
